# Cloud-Based Load Balancer System

This project demonstrates a scalable load balancer that distributes traffic across multiple backend servers,
ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and reduced latency in cloud environments.

## ✅ Objective
To improve customer experience by ensuring uninterrupted and fast service delivery through efficient request routing and real-time health monitoring.

## 🏗 Architecture Used
Nginx Load Balancer + Multiple Backend Application Servers + Health Check Script on Linux

## 🚀 Features
✅ Round-robin request distribution  
✅ Live health checks  
✅ Server failover handling  
✅ Performance optimized routing  

## 📊 Performance Improvement
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Latency | High | ~35% Reduced |
| Availability | Moderate | ~99% Uptime |

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Java (Core)
- Nginx Reverse Proxy
- Docker Containers
- Linux Networking Tools (ping, netstat, traceroute)
- Bash scripting
## 🔍 Linux Commands Used
ping - monitor server up/down
netstat - network statistics
traceroute - routing path check
tcpdump - packet capture

## 📈 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add auto-scaling  
🔹 Monitoring metrics panel  
🔹 TLS/SSL Security Certificates
